## Missing Search Feature
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d68f809-337b-4000-a407-28f915e9f4a2)

The search functionality intended for this project relies on an external API to retrieve data. However, during development, a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error was encountered while making requests to the provided API. This error occurs when the server does not allow requests from different origins due to security policies.
